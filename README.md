## K8S Task2: Practical Assignment
### You are given an application image that runs a web server.

Perform the following steps:
1. Create a Deployment that runs the application with at least 2 pods.
2. Ensure all pods are created successfully and are in Running state.
3. Create a NodePort Service to expose the application.
4. Access the application from a browser using:
    http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>
5. Verify that the application output is visible in the browser.
6. Take a screenshot of the browser output.
7. Create a README.md file and add:

      - Deployment name : **mydeploy**
      - Service type used : **NodePort**
      - URL used to access the application: **http://13.221.57.175:30319/**
      - Screenshot of the browser output :
